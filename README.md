# Philosophers Battle
A game for Ludum Dare 32 (http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=11335)

This is an epic battle of the minds!
Take the role as one of the most famous philosophers of history and convince your opponents of your worldview.

The game features 9 different philosophers, each with 3 general and 3 personal attacks based on their respective philosophy.
Attacks can deal damage to the conviction of the opponent if they are convincing; or they reduce his sanity if they are confusing.

Sanity is used as a defense and a mean to deal damage, so try to keep sane!

Esc for menu.

-------
The game is playable, but lacks some animation. Also some attacks should still get special effects other than damage and healing. More philosophers are planned, so don't complain, if your favourite philosopher is not in the crowd.

The downloadable version runs in Java, so to play it you need to have the Java virtual machine installed.
Under Windows just double-click the .jar file.
Under Linux run `java -jar philosophers_battle.jar` in a terminal.
